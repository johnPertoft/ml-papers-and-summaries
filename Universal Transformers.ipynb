    "## TLDR\n",
    "* The Tniversal Transformer is a generalization of the Transformer architecture.\n",
    "* Basically, for each token in input sequence\n",
    "    * Compute its representation via some self attention mechanism (and attention over encoder representations for the decoder)\n",
    "    * Apply transition function on each representation (the weights of the transition function are shared).\n",
    "    * Repeat this for some number of steps, i.e. the recurrence happens \"depth-wise\" rather than time wise.\n",
    "        * Also possible/beneficial to have dynamic halting here meaning different number of steps per token.\n",
