Collection of summaries/reviews of general machine learning models/algorithms and of papers I've written both for myself and for use in discussion in reading groups. Written in jupyter notebooks because it has easy integration with latex for equations.

Some are written as presentation slides and can be shown as such with
```bash
$ ./show-slides.sh mypresentation.ipynb
```
