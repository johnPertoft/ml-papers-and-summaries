    "## Introduction\n",
    "*Is more layers generally better for performance?*\n",
    "* Problems with vanishing/exploding gradients that hinders convergence.\n",
    "    * Mostly solved with intermediate normalization steps like *Batch Normalization*\n",
    "* Performance degradation of deeper networks.\n",
    "    * Not from overfitting, training error can increase when using a deeper network.\n",
    "    * This shouldn't be the case. Consider adding identity layers to a shallower net which shouldn't increase training error. This indicates that the problem lies with how optimization/learning happens.\n",
    "    * This paper addresses this degradation problem via residual mappings.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Residual mappings\n",
    "underlying mapping H(X) etc\n",
    "\n",
    "**In practice**\n",
    "* Short-cut connections, where the input to some stacked layers are also bypassing said layers and then added to the output of them.\n",
    "* No weights on the skip connection so no extra parameters. I.e. skip connections are identity mappings."
