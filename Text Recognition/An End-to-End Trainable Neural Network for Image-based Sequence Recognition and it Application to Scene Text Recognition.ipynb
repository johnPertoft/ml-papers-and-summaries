    "* This paper only concerns the OCR part, i.e. it doesn't find text in a larger image but rather assumes the text fills out most of the input image.\n",
    "* It's an early paper but sort of defines (not sure if first) a common basic structure that is built upon in future papers.\n",
    "* Highlevel steps are as follows\n",
    "    * Preprocess image to fixed height, width doesn't matter.\n",
    "    * Apply CNN on image to produce feature sequence of shape (1, ?).\n",
    "    * Apply RNN on feature sequence and output a character prediction at each timestep.\n",
    "    * CTC TODO, explain intuitively, in detail in other summary"
