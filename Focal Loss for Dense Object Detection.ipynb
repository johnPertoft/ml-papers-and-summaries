    "# Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "## TL;DR\n",
    "* Dense object detection often suffers from imbalanced data, many candidate locations but few positives.\n",
    "* Reduce the impact on total loss from easy examples.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "* Object detection are usually based on a two-stage approach or a one-stage approach.\n",
    "* Two-stage:\n",
    "    * First stage generates candidate object locations.\n",
    "    * Second stage classifies each candidate object location.\n",
    "    * (So far) SoTA but more complex pipeline.\n",
    "* One-stage:\n",
    "    * Dense predictions.\n",
    "    * (So far) Worse results but less complex pipeline.\n",
    "* Authors identify class imbalance to be the problem of worse results of one-stage detectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Focal Loss\n",
    "* Small adaptation to standard cross entropy loss (CE) to get dynamic scaling.\n",
    "* Intuitively: \n",
    "    * Scale down loss of easy examples.\n",
    "    * Decrease the range in which an example gets high loss.\n",
