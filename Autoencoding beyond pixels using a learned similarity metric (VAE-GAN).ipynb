    "# Autoencoding beyond pixels using a learned similarity metric\n",
    "* In short this paper combines a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a generative adversarial network (GAN) to form the VAE-GAN model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The idea is to use the feature representations that the discriminator of a GAN learns in the reconstruction objective of the VAE. Normal VAE is too concerned with pixel-wise errors but doing it this way should help with instead minimizing feature-wise errors to better capture the data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pixel-wise errors are not optimal for image data because they do not really model human visual perception. Small image translation that a human doesn't care about will give large pixel-wise errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* They also show some disentanglement of latent factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## VAE recap\n",
    "$z \\sim Enc(x) = q(z\\ \\lvert\\ x), \\quad \\hat{x} \\sim Dec(z) = p(x\\ \\lvert\\ z)$\n",
    "\n",
    "VAE loss consists of two parts\n",
    "* Regularization on latent space to be close to prior over $z$ (often $p(z) = \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$) via KL divergence $\\mathcal{L}_{prior} = KL(q(z\\ \\lvert\\ x) \\lVert p(z))$\n",
    "* Reconstruction loss which is the negative expected log likelihood (pixel-wise).\n",
    "\n",
    "## GAN recap\n",
    "* Two networks, generator and discriminator\n",
    "    * Generator generates data samples from noise $z$.\n",
    "    * Discriminator outputs probability that a sample is real (vs fake).\n",
    "    * Binary cross entropy $\\mathcal{L}_{GAN} = log(D(x)) + log(1 - D(G(z))$, minimize for training G, maximize for training D.\n",

    "### Architecture\n",

    "\n",
    "### Losses\n",
    "* The discriminator of GANs learns a good feature representation of data which we want to use for a loss.\n",
    "* They replace the reconstruction loss part of the VAE loss with a reconstruction loss expressed in discriminator.\n",
    "    * Pick a layer $D_l$ of discriminator.\n",
    "    * Choose gaussian as distribution over output at this layer, $p(D_l(x)\\ \\lvert\\ z) = \\mathcal{N}(D_l(x)\\ \\lvert\\ D_l(\\hat{x}), \\mathbf{I})$\n",
    "    * The new reconstruction error is $\\mathcal{L}_{llike}^{D_l} = -\\mathbb{E}_{q(z \\lvert x)} \\left[ log\\ p(D_l(x)\\ \\lvert\\ z) \\right]$\n",
    "    * So we minimize squared difference between $x$ and $\\hat{x}$\n",
    "    * They call this learned similarity.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Training\n",
    "* Limiting error signals to relevant network by using parts of whole loss for encoder, decoder/generator, and discriminator.\n",
    "    * Encoder is trained by minimizing $\\mathcal{L}_{prior} + \\mathcal{L}_{llike}^{D_l}$ w.r.t $\\theta_{encoder}$.\n",
    "    * Decoder/Generator is trained by minimizing $\\gamma \\mathcal{L}_{llike}^{D_l} + \\mathcal{L}_{GAN}$ w.r.t $\\theta_{decoder}$ (so in effect minimize $\\mathcal{L}_{GAN}$ becomes minimize $log(1 - D(G(z))$).\n",
    "    * Discriminator is trained by maximizing $\\mathcal{L}_{GAN}$\n",
